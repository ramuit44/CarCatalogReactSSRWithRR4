  "review": "The Mazda MX-5 is a traditional two-seat sports car, with a lightweight body and rear-wheel drive. It has a folding, fabric roof and is among the least expensive convertibles. This fourth-generation MX-5 is fantastic fun to drive. Motoring magazine Wheels named it Car of the Year for 2016."
